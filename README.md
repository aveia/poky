# poky
>>>>>>> f7aca57 (renamed it to poky)
A simple lisp-like language; current features:

- a laughable parser
- basic math operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- comparison operators (`>`, `>=`, `=`, `!=`, â€¦)
- the `pi` constant typed from memory (beware)
- `if` conditionals
- assignments with `set!`
- lexical scopes with `scope`
- `progn`

To-do:

- logical operators, lists, `defun`, et al.
